# Day 2 Of Python Learning 

This is a Day 2 of learning Python . Here Are some topics that need to be covered : 

## Table of Topics 

- [Windows, Linux and Mac Command Line Fundamentals](#cmd_fundamentals)
- [Windows and MAC Python Setup) ](#python_setup)
- [Numbers , Operators, Comments](#noc)

<b>This part of section will clear all your Lnux/Cmd Fundamentals as well as it will explain how to install python In Windows and Mac Easily and effciently . Then we will see about the topics like NUMBERS , OPERATOR and Comments in Python. <i>Let's Begin </i></b>

## Windows, Linux and Mac Command Line Fundamentals <a name = "cmd_fundamentals"></a>

- ### Windows Command Line and Powershell:
     <b>Command Prompt (CMD)</b> serves as a basic and legacy command-line tool inherited from MS-DOS, <b> PowerShell </b> stands as a robust and modern alternative with an extensive set of cmdlets and scripting capabilities, making it the go-to option for Windows system administration and automation tasks.
- ### Windows Command Prompt (CMD) vs. PowerShell:

| S.No 	| Command Line                                                          	| PowerShell                                                                           	|
|------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
|   1  	| Simple and traditional command-line interface.                        	| Modern and more advanced command-line interface.                                     	|
|   2  	| Uses basic commands inherited from MS-DOS                             	| Utilizes powerful commands called cmdlets, which are in the form of verb-noun pairs. 	|
|   3  	| Limited scripting capabilities, relying mostly on batch files (.bat). 	| Extensive scripting capabilities using PowerShell scripts (.ps1).                    	|
|   4  	| Commands and output are usually less verbose.                         	| Commands and output are more verbose, allowing for better clarity.                   	|
|   5  	| Primarily used by older systems and for compatibility reasons.        	| Preferred choice for system administration and automation tasks on Windows.          	|

<u>It is most common between developers to use PowerShell as it is more similar to linux </u>

In this Repo we will be more focused to PowerShell then CMD

#### Commands for File Navigation for PowerShell:
- <b>cd </b>: Change directory (e.g., cd C:\Users).

- <b>pwd</b>: Print Working Directory

- <b>Get-ChildItem or gci</b>  : List files and directories in the current directory . This can also be achieved by <b>ls</b> command

- <b>Set-Location or sl</b> : Equivalent to cd.

- <b>cd ..</b> : Move one level down in the directory structure.

- <b>cd ~</b> : This will take you back to Home Directory 

#### Commands for File Creation for PowerShell:

## Windows and MAC Python Setup <a name = "python_setup"></a>
- Input Device: Devices like keyboard and mouse through which users provide input to a computer system.
- Output Device: Devices like monitors and printers that display or produce output from a computer system.
- CPU (Central Processing Unit): The brain of a computer system that carries out instructions and performs calculations.
- Memory: The storage component of a computer system that holds data and instructions being actively used.
- Computer Organization: The structure and components of a computer system, including hardware and software.
- Operating System: The software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing a user interface.

## Numbers , Operators, Comments <a name = "noc"></a>
- Programming languages enable us to communicate with computers and give them instructions.
- They allow us to automate tasks, solve problems, and create applications.
- Programming languages provide the ability to write algorithms, manipulate data, and perform complex computations.
