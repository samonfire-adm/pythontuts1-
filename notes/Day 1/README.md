## Introduction <a name = "intro_to_python"></a>

- Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
- It is widely used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.
- Python code is executed by an interpreter, making it an interpreted language.
    
    ### Scope of Python <a name = "scope"></a>
    - Python has a vast scope and is used for developing applications, scripting, and automation tasks.
    - It can be used for creating web applications, desktop GUIs, scientific computing, and data analysis.
    - Python is extensively used in machine learning and artificial intelligence projects.



## Background Part <a name = "background_part"></a>
- Input Device: Devices like keyboard and mouse through which users provide input to a computer system.
- Output Device: Devices like monitors and printers that display or produce output from a computer system.
- CPU (Central Processing Unit): The brain of a computer system that carries out instructions and performs calculations.
- Memory: The storage component of a computer system that holds data and instructions being actively used.
- Computer Organization: The structure and components of a computer system, including hardware and software.
- Operating System: The software that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing a user interface.

## Why Do we Need Programming <a name = "need_of_programming"></a>
- Programming languages enable us to communicate with computers and give them instructions.
- They allow us to automate tasks, solve problems, and create applications.
- Programming languages provide the ability to write algorithms, manipulate data, and perform complex computations.
